## Description
According to a [recent study](https://www.christopherreeve.org/living-with-paralysis/stats-about-paralysis) in US,
nearly 1 in 50 people live with paralysis â€“ approximately 5.4 million people. They end up spending $158 billion 
on home care and nursing home services combined and hence carries it carries substantial 
[individual and societal costs](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/spinal-cord-injury).

*PyBlink* is a novel approach to address this problem. By identifying simple gestures (using computer vision and 
leveraging the power of ubiquitous IOT devices) nursing homes can monitor multiple patients/nursing beds simultaneously.
